                <h1>French restaurants of the 19th century</h1>
                <p>French restaurants today are usually in one of three categories: the bistro, or brasserie, 
                    a simple, informal, and inexpensive establishment; the medium-priced restaurant; and the more elegant grand restaurant, 
                    where the most intricate dishes are executed and served in luxurious surroundings.</p>
